# Crimes in Philadelphia - Using R on Shiny

## Introduction

There are two main features in this app:
* Under the Graphs tab, you will find a scatterplot of total number of crimes in Philadelphia from 2009 to 2016. On this page, you will be able to select some data points, regress a line, and see the slope and intercept.
* Under the Maps tab, you will find a slider and an interactive map. On this page, you will be able to view the number of crimes by census tract in each year from 2009 to 2016 upon using the slider.
